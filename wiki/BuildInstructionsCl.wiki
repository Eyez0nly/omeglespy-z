#summary Instructions for building the omeglespy-z-cl

= Building omeglespy-z-core =

omeglespy-z-cl is a command line based omeglespy-z application. Like omeglespy-z-desktop, omeglespy-z-cl is built on top of omegle-spy-z-core.

== Details ==

First, make certain you meet the prerequisites (BuildInstructions).

Second, you will check out the code from SVN.

Third, ???.

Fourth, you will invoke the maven build.

Fifth, profit.

=== Check out the code from subversion ===

If you have a subversion commandline client, just cd to your preferred directory and invoke

{{{
svn checkout http://omeglespy-z.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/omeglespy-z-cl omeglespy-z-read-only
}}}

If you have one of those new fangled GUI-based subversion clients, you're on your own :P.

Note that you can also find source that corresponds to the various releases of omeglespy-z-cl at http://omeglespy-z.googlecode.com/svn/tags/omeglespy-z-cl

=== ??? ===

Maybe you modify the code? Or something?

=== Invoke the maven build ===

There are a number of maven tasks available, but I'd recommend just running the package task. It's reasonably quick, and it gives you everything you need.

cd into the project root (you'll know you're there because you'll see pom.xml in the directory listing). Then invoke

{{{
mvn package
}}}

=== Profit ===

Everything you'd ever want should be in the /target directory. Enjoy!
