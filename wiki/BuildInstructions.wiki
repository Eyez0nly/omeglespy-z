#summary Instructions for building omeglespy-z.
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Build Instructions =
== Prerequisites ==
  * JDK 5 or higher (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * Maven 2 or higher (http://maven.apache.org/download.html if you use maven 3 and run into an issue, please fill out an issue)
  * A subversion client

Please note that you can also run the build by using Eclipse Helios or higher with the latest version of m2e installed. But if you're smart enough to get that installed, you're probably smart enough to not need this guide.

== Details ==

=== Check out the code from subversion ===

If you have a subversion commandline client, just cd to your preferred directory and invoke

{{{
svn checkout http://omeglespy-z.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ omeglespy-z-read-only
}}}

If you have one of those new fangled GUI-based subversion clients, you're on your own :P.

=== Invoke the maven build ===

There are a number of maven tasks available, but I'd recommend just running the package task. It's reasonably quick, and it gives you everything you need.

cd into the project root (you'll know you're there because you'll see pom.xml in the directory listing). Then invoke

{{{
mvn package
}}}

=== ??? ===

=== Profit ===

Everything you'd ever want should be in the /target directory. Enjoy!
