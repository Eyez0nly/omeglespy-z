    <strong>OmegleSpyX is a freeware and opensource application that allows you to 
    &#39;spy&#39; on peoples conversations on Omegle. You can also send text as either user, block messages, disconnect users, and even swap a user without the other knowing. 
    Some future plans include support for spying on video mode chats as well. </strong>I 
    am always looking for good coders and other contributers to help with the 
    OmegleSpyX project, see our webpage&#39;s &#39;Contibute&#39; page.<br><br>Notice: Before you can start chatting you need to initialize OmegleSpyX. If the program feezes during the initialization process then please check your internet connection is working properly.<br>
