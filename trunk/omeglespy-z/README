1. ${project.artifactId} ${project.version} Introduction
==================================================================================

Thank you for downloading ${project.artifactId} from https://code.google.com/p/omeglespy-z. If you
downloaded this zip-file from another site, please check https://code.google.com/p/omeglespy-z for
the latest official release.

This version has a lot of new exciting features, such as:

 * disconnecting a stranger if they type in crap about web cams.
 * allowing you to replace a disconnected stranger without ending the conversation.
 * keyboard shortcuts for common tasks.
 * retooling the connection script to reduce the occurrence of recaptcha challenges
 * miscellaneous other fun stuff. 

At this point of development, we need your help with testing, bug report and feature
discussion, please post your feedback, comments and bugs to:

https://code.google.com/p/omeglespy-z/issues/list

      OmegleSpyRecaptchaWindow.properties (found in the root of
      /lib/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar) to your language, and if you would like
      ${project.artifactId} to officially support your language in later releases, please email me
      your translation)
