1. ${project.artifactId} ${project.version} Introduction
==================================================================================

Thank you for downloading ${project.artifactId} from https://code.google.com/p/omeglespy-z. If you
downloaded this zip-file from another site, please check https://code.google.com/p/omeglespy-z for
the latest official release.

This version has a lot of new exciting features, such as:

 * allowing you to replace a disconnected stranger without ending the conversation.
 * keyboard shortcuts for common tasks.
 * retooling the connection script to reduce the occurrence of recaptcha challenges
 * miscellaneous other fun stuff. 

At this point of development, we need your help with testing, bug report and feature
discussion, please post your feedback, comments and bugs to:

https://code.google.com/p/omeglespy-z/issues/list

NOTE: This is the command line version of omeglespy-z. What's more, it's a BETA, so you will run
	  into issues. ADDITIONALLY, you still have to run this application in a graphical environment.
	  That's because how else are you going to see the recaptchas?

${project.artifactId} should run on any Windows (98x, ME, XP, Vista, 7), Mac OSX (10.4+), or
Linux (tested on KDE and GNOME desktops) box with the Java 1.4.2+ runtime installed.
