omeglespy-z-cl

  omeglespy-z-cl is a command-line version of
  {{https://omeglespy-z.googlecode.com/svn/sites/omeglespy-z-desktop/index.html}omeglespy-z-desktop}}.
  omeglespy-z-cl is also written in java, and it shares many of the same
  features as its desktop counterpart, allowing you to "spy" on  strangers
  chatting on {{http://www.omegle.com}}, to  impersonate either of the
  strangers, to disconnect either stranger, and to replace either stranger
  with a brand new stranger.
  
  There are some differences, though. Since omeglespy-z-cl is a command-line
  application, it's fully text-based. Even the recaptcha images are converted
  to ASCII art prior to being displayed.\*
  
* system requirements

  * <<OS>>: Windows 9x/XP/Vista/7 (probably even 8) or Mac OSX (10.4\+) or Linux
  running an X server (until I patch the app with the headless version of the
  AWT).
  
  * <<JVM>>: any standards compliant Java Virtual Machine 1.4.2 or greater
  (hint: you probably already have this).

  []
  
  So basically as long as you're not using a machine from the mid-90s, you
  should be able to run the app.

* installation

  First download the application archive
  {{{http://omeglespy-z.googlecode.com/files/omeglespy-z-cl-${projectVersion}-distribution.zip}here}}.
  
  Second unzip the archive somewhere.
  
  Third go to the location where you unzipped the archive.
  
  Navigate to the <<<bin>>> folder. If you're running windows, invoke
  <<<omeglespy-z-cl.bat>>>. If you're running Linux or Mac OSX, invoke the
  <<<omeglespy-z-cl>>> shell script.
  
  If nothing happens, there might be an issue. Report it at
  {{https://code.google.com/p/omeglespy-z/issues/list}}.
  
* how to use it

  I tried to make the interface as simple as possible, but what do I know about
  console interfaces? I prefer vi over nano.
  
  For a full list of available commands, type "\\?" (without the quotes) and
  press enter.
  
  For the most part, the commands take the form
  <<<\\[some letter][an argument][\> or \<]>>>
  
  The back slash indicates that we're starting a command. The next character
  indicates which command we'll be invoking, and the \> or \< indicate the
  target of the command. \< targets Stranger1 and \> targets Stranger2.
  
  Be aware that some of the commands don't require a target.
  
** but what if i just want to send a message???
  
  In order to send a message to one of the strangers, you just type
  <<<your message here[either \> or \<]>>>
  
  By the way, if you leave off the target, the message goes to both strangers.
  
* typical application flow
  
  When the application starts, it attempts to connect to omegle immediately.
  You'll be notified that a conversation is beginning and that Stranger1 and
  Stranger2 are connecting. If you're lucky, they'll just connect. If you're
  unlucky, you'll be notified that you must defeat a recaptcha.
  
  Let's say that you're told you must defeat a recaptcha. Type
  
  <<<\\v\<>>>
  
  to view the recaptcha for Stranger1. Then type
  
  <<<\\rrecaptcharesponsegoeshere\<>>>
  
  to send your response for Stranger1. If you fucked up, you'll be told.
  Otherwise assume you succeeded.
  
  Now repeat the same thing for Stranger2 (using \> instead of \<).
  
  Now screw around with the strangers (\\s< to swap Stranger1, \\d> to
  disconnect Stranger2, etc). Then, when you're done, type
  
  <<<\\q>>>
  
  to quit.

  \* This makes recaptchas harder to read :(
